This project is the thin layer between cubefriendly and MapDB. Most of the logic can be found in https://github.com/cubefriendly/cubefriendly-core.

This project tries to stay as simple as possible to ease optimisations.
Hopefully it should not change too much so the access layer between cubefriendly and the cube files stay stable.
